# Phaser Tutorial
Experimental repo for learning and teaching JavaScript.

Welcome Broc!
We're going to try to learn some Github and JavaSript skills with this project.

Here are the first steps you need to follow to get started.
If you don't know how to do something, look it up on Google, StackOverflow.com, and of course you can always ask me anything!

1. Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Get the test page up and running locally:
- `npm -g install browser-sync`
- `cd /path/to/phaser/`
- `browser-sync start --server --files="**/*.js"`
- Browse to `localhost:3000` in your browser (Chrome or Firefox, etc.). You should see the words "The homepage works!"
